# Soft dark theme extension for Vscode

A **custom VS Code theme** built for **comfort, consistency, and aesthetics**.  
This isn’t just another theme with random flashy colors — it’s carefully designed to reduce eye strain, remove harsh contrasts, and bring **harmony across syntax highlighting and the entire VS Code UI**.  
>*I personally tested it in full day condition and at the night, and it is very easy on my eyes and I didn't felt overwhelmed with the colors and contrasts, u may feel the colors are a bit odd, i.e. because they are choosen to blend well with each other and not to compromise aesthetics too*

##  Why This Exists

I got tired of themes that either:  
- Use **neon bright colors** that burn your eyes, or  
- Mix random **contrasting colors** that don’t blend together.  

So I created my own.  
This theme is about:  
- **Softer dark background** (`#1B1B1B`) that isn’t pitch black.  
- **Muted syntax colors** that separate tags, attributes, strings, keywords, and variables without clashing.  
- **Consistent UI theming** — from tabs and dropdowns to settings and extension badges.  

The result → **coding feels calm and comfortable**, even after hours.
